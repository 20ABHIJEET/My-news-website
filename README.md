# My-news-website
I created a fully functional news website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating a News API to fetch real-time articles. With a modern responsive design, category filters, and search functionality, the site works smoothly across devices, delivering updated news on politics, business, sports, entertainment, and technology.
